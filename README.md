# bcc2telegraf
bcc2telegraf is an integration that sends ebpf-based bcc histogram metrics (https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)  to telegraf daemon (https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf)

Original bcc/table.py v.0.10 just printed histograms to stdout.
This extension instead creates a memory buffer full of text lines formatted to the requirements of telegraf line protocol and sends it by http to telegraf url .

Sample telegraf lines generated by this module:

"ebpf,metric=biolatency,host=abc.example.com,dc=east-1,tag1=dm-14,cloud=Nine,hi=1024 value=777 1645026564"
"ebpf,metric=biolatency,host=abc.example.com,dc=east-1,tag1=dm-14,cloud=Nine,hi=2048 value=88 1645026564"


You may create some function which extends tag1 with some other tags, based on the histogram bucket struct key described in ebpf C program
e.g. your_function returns "8.8.8.8,cloud=GCP" 
pass this function to this API: send_log2_hist (... bucket_fn=your_function...)
and telegraf line will contain "... tag1=8.8.8.8,cloud=GCP..."

Usage: 
- set TELEGRAF_URL environment variable to your telegraf service 
- copy a python-based bcc program
- edit it, adding an
          import bcc2telegraf
    and replace instances of 
          dist.print_log2_hist(label...)
    with 
          dist.send_log2_hist(label...)
    or with 
          dist.send_log2_hist(label,bucket_fn=your_function...)
 - maybe create a systemctl-managed service out of that program
